# Duck-duck-clone



To run this project out we will have to divide the duck-duck home page in sub-page
each sub-page will be developed in a different branch and at the end of the work we will have to merge all the branches to the main/master branch.
Each sub-page will have its own developemnt strategy.
And we can follow each progress in the project board named `duckproject`
